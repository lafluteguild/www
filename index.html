  <b>Los Angeles Flute Guild</b>
  <hr>
  <b>History:</b>
  <br> The Los Angeles Flute Guild was an organization for flutists in the Los Angeles area.  It was active until some time in 2019, after which 
  this domain name was taken over by squatters that redirected it to a chinese gambling site :(
  <br>I have rescued the domain from the squatters to host this landing page until a better idea presents itself.
  <br>
  <br>The last remnants of the Los Angeles Flute Guild can be found in this archive of the old website:
  <br><a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518053544/http://lafluteguild.com/>archive.org: lafluteguild.com</a>
  <br>
  <br>Additionally the group's facebook page lingers on:
